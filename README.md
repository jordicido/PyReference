# Python reference Repository

This is just a Python repository with some of the things I usually don't remember how to use/implement. By doing this I'm trying to have a deeper knowledge of all these difficult (usually, for me) topics about a language that I'm currently learning (Python) and maybe retaining a  bit better the information.

Feel free to use it and to store it or share with other people.
